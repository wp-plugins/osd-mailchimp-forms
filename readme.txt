OSD MailChimp Forms allows you to add as many MailChimp subscription forms to your pages as needed.

== Description ==

OSD MailChimp Forms gives the ability to add MailChimp subscription forms to be placed anywhere on your site with a shortcode. The primary benefit of this plugin is that it allows multiple AJAX forms on one page. So, you could have a newsletter signup in the footer, a blog signup in the sidebar, and another blog subscription signup in the main content area.  The plugin allows for custom submission messages, field classes, form classes, custom submit button text, and removal of the double opt in emails! NO styling is placed on the forms by this plugin, so there is nothing to override. Use your theme's default styling or add custom styles. Simply enter your api key and start creating / placing forms in your content or Text Widgets.

Shortcode basic example:
[osd-mc-form id='osd_mc_forms_1']

Shortcode all options example:
[osd-mc-form id='osd_mc_forms_1' class='custom-class' submit_text='Sign Up!']
